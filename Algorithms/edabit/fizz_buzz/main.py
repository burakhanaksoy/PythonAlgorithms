# Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz".

# If the number is a multiple of 3 the output should be "Fizz".
# If the number given is a multiple of 5, the output should be "Buzz".
# If the number given is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the output should be "FizzBuzz".
# If the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, the number should be output on its own as shown in the examples below.
# The output should always be a string even if it is not a multiple of 3 or 5.
